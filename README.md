This is the repository of the first and also biggest project I had so far.
"AutoFolder.ahk" is a sorting application that helps you to manage your daily ammount of files. 
The project is designed around online classes and the often huge ammounts of different files that come with them, but can also be used as a multi-purpose tool.

The Application consists of 3 main parts: the installer, the main application containing information and settings,
and the script itself, that will be operating silently in the background.

My progress can be tracked by the ammount of files uploaded and the frequency of the uploads. 
The description of the individual uploads should also give a rough idea of the changes made and the fixes that still need to be made.

I do not plan to do any pre-releases, you will have to wait for the final product, whose deadline is set to the 1st of January 2022.

I will provide a short summary of the progress of the 3 parts here. This summary WILL be updated:


Installer:  	waiting for final polish; about 95% done

-mostly done

-needs minor changes to the size and positioning of the controls on the UI

-works from a functional standpoint


Main Gui:  currently in focus; about 80% done

-close to done

-needs a little bit of work on the saving process

-An UpDown is still in progress and will be added to the Main UI(The progress of the UpDown can be tracked seperately, 
 temporary versions are  being uploaded with the name "UpDownTemplate[Iteration]")
 
-needs to be polished afterwards


Main script:   waiting for rework; about 15% done

-needs to be completely reworked

-the concept will be copied from an old version

-the code itself will be rewritten from the ground up

-Lessons learned from the other parts of the project need to be applied
